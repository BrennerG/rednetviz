# Reddit Cross Reference Vizualization

# 1.1 GOALS
A Vizualization, that enables the user to explore reddit through the cross references of its subs.
The subreddits shall be displayed as a graph network that shows how the subs reference each other and how strong the connections are.
Additional data for the posts in the graph shall be displayable and they should be linked to the original reddit source in some kind of way.
The goal is to provide an explorative research tool for people to:
	A) find new subreddits in a quick and explorative manner
	B) enable the user to make conclusion about the causality of subreddit cross references
